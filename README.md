# odin-recipes
The Odin Project - My first Website

As told by instructions, I developed my first website called Odin Recipes
I used everything I've learned so far:
Including the boilerplate,
the heading tag, image tag, anchor tag, paragraph tag, unordered list 
and ordered lists as well.
I used the terminal and git commands to push the files to the repo.
