            peeled and chopped into bite-sized chunks <br>

        <li>100g frozen chopped onions</li>
        <li>4 heaped tbsp mild curry paste (we used korma)</li>
        <li>400g can chopped tomatoes</li>
        <li>400g can light coconut milk</li>
        <li>mini naan bread, to serve</li>
        <li>400g can lentils, drained</li>
        <li>200g bag baby spinach</li>
        <li>150ml coconut yogurt (we used Rachel's Organic), plus extra to serve
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
    <h2>How to do:</h2>
    <div class="container-list">
        <ol>
         <li>Heat the oil in a large pan. Put the squash in a bowl with a splash of water. <br>
            Cover with cling film and microwave on High for 10 mins or until tender. <br>
            Meanwhile, add the onions to the hot oil and cook for a few mins until soft. <br>
            Add the curry paste, tomatoes and coconut milk, and simmer <br>
            for 10 mins until thickened  to a rich sauce.</li>
        <li>Warm the naan breads in a low oven or in the toaster. <br>
            Drain any liquid from the squash, then add to the sauce with the lentils, <br>
            spinach and some seasoning. Simmer for a further 2-3 mins to wilt the spinach, <br>
            then stir in the coconut yogurt. <br>
            Serve with the warm naan and a dollop of extra yogurt.</li>
         <li>Enjoy!</li>
